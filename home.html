                        the neighborhood is very quiet, with only the rare vehicle driving past.

                    Here are some exterior photos of the house from the summer.  This first one is looking from the street.  The roof is newly replaced, just over 1 year old.

                    There is a circular driveway in front of the 3 car garage that facilitates turning around.  The gardens and asphalt are well maintained.
